# Changelog

## 0.8.0

- **Plague sickness.** Standing on plagued ground now builds exposure on YOU — slowly, over
  tens of minutes. Stamina fails first, then healing; the sickness weakens but can never
  kill. It shows as a status icon (vanilla's own bar) and fades away from blighted land —
  faster rested, slower to take hold with poison resistance. Leaving and rejoining is not a
  cure: exposure is persisted per player, world-scoped, in the same admin-editable format as
  everything else.
- **The chill.** Land deep in frost now bites players the weather alone would not — unless
  they carry frost resistance, stand by a fire, or shelter. Never lethal, never Freezing.

## 0.7.1

First packaged build. Everything below verified live on a dedicated server.

- **Zone sync + plague miasma.** The server now pushes each player the zone state around
  them (absolute snapshots, self-healing on packet loss), and clients render a procedural
  grey-green fog in zones past the plague threshold. Fresh seeds stay invisible — the fog is
  how you *discover* a zone has turned, not a minimap.
- **Titles.** Stormrider, Plaguewalker, Winterborn — earned from world events, shown under
  nameplates, persisted world-scoped in an admin-editable ledger. Announced once, never spam.
- **World condition.** The land judges itself from total burden (Flourishing / Stable /
  Ailing / Stricken) and announces only real turning points — transitions are
  hysteresis-guarded so they cannot flap.
- **Ecology.** Sustained plague or scorch corrupts the ground under it, and corruption feeds
  plague growth — the first feedback loop. Severable by config.
- **Farming.** Dense crops tire a zone's soil over time; rest heals it. (Growth/yield effects
  read from this in a future build.)
- **Plague.** Grows where players linger, spreads zone-to-zone along its frontier, rides
  storms, dies back through winter or neglect; a cure that reaches zero is permanent.
- **Fire scars.** With FireFront installed, burning zones accrue Scorch that outlives the
  flames and slows the land's recovery. Without it, the system sleeps.
- **Devastating Storms.** Real vanilla events on our schedule; fire risk, wind and plague
  spread rise inside the storm's area only. The sky is never forced (default).
- **Seasons.** Gameplay-only clock with Seasonality auto-deferral.
- **Persistence.** World-scoped, atomic, fail-safe stores: corrupt files quarantine loudly
  instead of vanishing silently, values clamp on read as well as write, and everything is
  plain tab-separated text.
